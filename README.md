# RPG Tutorial

A simple RPG created in Unity.

## Getting Started

1. Install git-lfs. This involves adding the package to apt through packagecloud.io. Follow their [installation instructions](https://packagecloud.io/github/git-lfs/install). Once you have added git-lfs to your list of apt sources then you need to actually install it by running `sudo apt-get install git-lfs`. Once git-lfs is installed then you need to activate it. You can activate it globally or remotely. I recommend locally with `git lfs install --local`. This will make this repo a git-lfs repo.
